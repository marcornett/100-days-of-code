# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Laying out components for user input. Learning about date & time objects in JavaScript. Figuring out how to make the time to update in real time in realtime. Trying to collect user input from date tag.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how to apply the difference for two different dates and then apply the countdown.

### Day 2: November 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setting up form with input tags. Looking into "moment" npm package that is used for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Reminding myself how to use one handle change method for multiple input tags using the event target name as a identifier.

**Thoughts:** Need to move further past these small issues with handling inputs in React to tackle the real issue with the date calculation.

### Day 3: November 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to work on something different every few days to have a change. Working on a bot that can go to a website and purchase something for you. Currently have it working to open up a provided URL, click on certain buttons and input data.

**Thoughts:** I think it is pretty interesting how it works in Python. Curious if there are more efficient processes but will keep going forward.

### Day 4: November 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to the countdown timer app. Setting up calculation to get countdown until a certain date. Trying to understand how to get the proper format of a React input tag to match the moment format.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 5: November 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More research on solving a calculation difference with two sets of dates. Currently, found a better solution to supply the new date function with the user input date to compare to the moment date. Need to do more research with moment.

**Thoughts:** So I thought this would be little easier and I may just be over thinking it but it is a fun challenge so far. Moment seems to be an interesting tool filled with optional date modifications.

### Day 6: November 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring to handle some confusion. Handle date change sets user input date to state. Use effect grabs current date and calculates the difference between user input date and current. Need to format date to look more presentable. Using npm package [moment-duration-format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-duration-format) to get a properly formatted date. Got the two dates differences into a string.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 7: November 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted countdown string to create an array of each unit of time to properly separate into state. Rendering timer component that has separate measurements of time. Beginning user input for time of day to get an even more accurate countdown to an event.

**Thoughts:** Glad things are moving sooner. At this stage, I will button up functionality and move on to CSS. Will draft layout ideas or search online for UI components to render a countdown timer.
