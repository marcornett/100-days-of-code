# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Laying out components for user input. Learning about date & time objects in JavaScript. Figuring out how to make the time to update in real time in realtime. Trying to collect user input from date tag.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how to apply the difference for two different dates and then apply the countdown.
