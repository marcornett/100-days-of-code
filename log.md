# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Laying out components for user input. Learning about date & time objects in JavaScript. Figuring out how to make the time to update in real time in realtime. Trying to collect user input from date tag.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how to apply the difference for two different dates and then apply the countdown.

### Day 2: November 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setting up form with input tags. Looking into "moment" npm package that is used for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Reminding myself how to use one handle change method for multiple input tags using the event target name as a identifier.

**Thoughts:** Need to move further past these small issues with handling inputs in React to tackle the real issue with the date calculation.

### Day 3: November 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to work on something different every few days to have a change. Working on a bot that can go to a website and purchase something for you. Currently have it working to open up a provided URL, click on certain buttons and input data.

**Thoughts:** I think it is pretty interesting how it works in Python. Curious if there are more efficient processes but will keep going forward.

### Day 4: November 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to the countdown timer app. Setting up calculation to get countdown until a certain date. Trying to understand how to get the proper format of a React input tag to match the moment format.

**Thoughts:**
